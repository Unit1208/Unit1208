Hi there! I'm @Unit1208.  
This is an alternate account for privacy. However, I have plenty of experience elsewhere. I might expand on this profile later.  
Sorry for the lack of examples. Most of my work was done on another account that I can't link to without comprimising my privacy.  
I'm interested in various things. My projects folder just keeps getting larger, but I never seem to finish any.   
Primarily, I like working on computer graphics and related fields. I've written a [ray tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) after reading the excellent [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) series and implemented [marching cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) from only the lookup tables. 
## Other Hobbies  
- Generative Neural Networks, like those in [LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) and [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion).  
- Datamoshing, the intentional corruption of image or video files for artistic effect  
- Small games. I've made countless.
